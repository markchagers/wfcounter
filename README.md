# wfcounter (Wordfeud counter)

This is a little fun project I've been using to explore Vue 3 with typescript and vue-class-component and vue-property-decorator thrown in. 

You can see it working [HERE](https://marksman-do.nl/wfcounter/)

The idea is that you input the letters in your Wordfeud game and automatically see which letters are still available.

This started out as a vue 2 project, but I wanted to take advantage of typescript and the class syntax so I converted it to vue 3 with typescript.

If I have time and I feel motivated, I may add more functionality such as the ability to save a game in progress.
